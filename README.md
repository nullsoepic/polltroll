# Poll Troll

Just a tiny desktop app I threw together quickly to play with Discord polls. This is a simple GUI for splitting a large text input into chunks and sending them as polls in Discord.

Very scuffed as it's mostly just intended for testing and Discord will most likely add a sperate permission for polls which will make them not as abusable
