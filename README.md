# Poll Troll

> [!WARNING]
> Discord has added a `Create Polls` permission (April 17 2024) <br>
> If a user does not have this permission they will not be able to post polls, we will show a generic `Unable to create poll` error with an option to retry

Just a tiny desktop app I threw together quickly to play with Discord polls. This is a simple GUI for splitting a large text input into chunks and sending them as polls in Discord.

Very scuffed as it's mostly just intended for testing and Discord will most likely add a sperate permission for polls which will make them not as abusable
